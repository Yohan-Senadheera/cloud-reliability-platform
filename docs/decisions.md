## Decision: Use GitHub Copilot for Initial Project Structure

### Reason
- Accelerates bootstrapping without spending time on manual scaffolding
- Allows early focus on architecture and reliability rather than folder setup

### Outcome
- A clean initial layout that can evolve as the project grows
- Structure separates concerns early (code, docs, infrastructure, runbooks)

### Alternatives Considered
- Manual folder creation (rejected – slower and error-prone)
